# Toolkit of Self

An AI-powered personal system designed to help individuals align with their biology, behaviors, and beliefs — starting with women’s health.

This project began with a question: *How do I create a tool that helps me understand myself — my patterns, my rhythms, my mind?*

Through years of exploration, I’ve come to believe that our bodies hold deep intelligence — and for women, there’s an added layer of complexity and opportunity embedded in the menstrual cycle. Yet so many of us move through these phases without truly understanding what’s happening or how it’s shaping our energy, thoughts, and behavior. There’s an immense opportunity being left on the table.

The menstrual cycle, when understood, isn’t a disruption — it’s a powerful framework for planning, reflection, and alignment. When paired with AI and intentional design, it becomes a tool for unlocking something much deeper: the Self.

The Toolkit of Self is my ongoing attempt to build what I wish existed. A place to track, learn, and evolve.

This is my passion, obsession, all I think about. 

**All roads lead back to Ki.**

Much love,
